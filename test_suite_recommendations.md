# Recommendations for Modernizing the cBioPortal MCP Server Test Suite

Based on a review of `cbioportal_server.py` and the existing tests in `test_cbioportal_server.py` and `test_pagination.py`, here are recommendations to modernize the test suite, enhance robustness, and align with current best practices:

## I. General Testing Framework and Practices

1.  **Consider `pytest` over `unittest`**:
    *   **Why**: `pytest` offers a more concise syntax, powerful fixture model (reducing boilerplate like `setUp`), extensive plugin ecosystem (e.g., `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-cov` for coverage), and better support for parametrization. This can lead to more readable and maintainable tests.
    *   **Action**: Gradually migrate or write new tests using `pytest`.

2.  **Modernize Asynchronous Testing**:
    *   **Why**: While `asyncio.run()` in each test works, dedicated async test runners provide better integration and cleaner syntax.
    *   **Action**:
        *   If sticking with `unittest`, use `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` as the base class for your test cases. This provides a fresh event loop for each test method.
        *   If moving to `pytest`, use the `pytest-asyncio` plugin and mark your async test functions with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

3.  **Embrace Fixtures for Setup and Mock Data**:
    *   **Why**: `pytest` fixtures are more flexible and reusable than `setUp` methods for managing test dependencies like server instances, mock data, and mock API responses.
    *   **Action**: Refactor `setUp` methods and inline mock data into `pytest` fixtures. This makes it clearer what each test depends on.

4.  **Use Parametrization for Repetitive Tests**:
    *   **Why**: Many of your pagination tests check similar logic for different endpoints. Parametrization reduces code duplication.
    *   **Action**: Use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test multiple endpoints or scenarios with a single test function template.

## II. Enhancing Existing Test Coverage and Structure

1.  **Refine `test_cbioportal_server.py`**:
    *   **Lifecycle Management (`startup`, `shutdown`)**:
        *   The `__init__` method now initializes `self.client`, and `startup` re-initializes it. Clarify if this is intended.
        *   Test that the `startup` and `shutdown` methods correctly initialize and close the `httpx.AsyncClient`. You can mock `httpx.AsyncClient` itself to assert it's called and `aclose()` is called.
        *   Verify that these methods are correctly registered as `on_startup` and `on_shutdown` hooks with the `FastMCP` instance.
    *   **Tool Registration (`_register_tools`)**:
        *   Add a test to ensure all intended public API-exposing methods in `CBioPortalMCPServer` are dynamically registered as MCP tools. You can inspect `self.server.mcp.tools` after initialization.
    *   **Error Handling Consistency**:
        *   While `test_error_handling` exists, expand this to cover various error scenarios (API errors, network issues, unexpected data format) for a broader range of tool methods, not just `get_cancer_studies`. Ensure the error response format (`{"error": "message"}`) is consistent.

2.  **Refactor and Expand `test_pagination.py`**:
    *   **Granular Tests for `paginate_results`**:
        *   This is a core utility. Add specific unit tests for `paginate_results` covering:
            *   Empty API response (no results).
            *   API response with fewer items than `page_size`.
            *   API response with exactly `page_size` items.
            *   Multiple full pages of results.
            *   Behavior when `max_pages` limit is reached.
            *   Handling of API errors occurring midway through pagination.
    *   **Test `collect_all_results` More Directly**:
        *   Verify its interaction with `paginate_results`.
        *   Test the `limit` parameter thoroughly to ensure it stops fetching and returns the correct number of items, even if more are available via pagination.
    *   **Break Down Large Test Methods**: Some test methods in `test_pagination.py` (e.g., `test_get_mutations_in_gene_pagination`) are quite long. Split them into smaller, more focused tests for better readability and easier debugging. For example, separate tests for basic pagination, pagination with sorting, and pagination with limits for each key endpoint.
    *   **Clarity on Mocked Returns for Pagination**: Ensure mocks clearly simulate the cBioPortal API's behavior where a page may have fewer items than `pageSize`, signaling the end of results.

3.  **Tests for Concurrent Fetching Methods**:
    *   For `get_multiple_studies` and `get_multiple_genes`:
        *   Mock the underlying single-item fetch methods (e.g., the calls made within `fetch_study` or `fetch_gene_batch`).
        *   Verify that `asyncio.gather` is used and called with the correct set of awaitables.
        *   Test how aggregated results are formed.
        *   Test error handling: if one of the concurrent calls fails, how does the main method behave? Does it return partial results, or an aggregated error? The current implementation seems to let exceptions from `_make_api_request` propagate in the gather, which then fails the entire `get_multiple_genes` or `get_multiple_studies` call. This might be desired, but tests should confirm it.

## III. Adding New Types of Tests for Robustness

1.  **Input Validation Tests (Lightweight)**:
    *   **Why**: While the cBioPortal API does most validation, your server methods might have implicit assumptions or could benefit from basic checks.
    *   **Action**: For parameters like `page_size` or `direction`, if there are specific constraints or expected values (e.g., `direction` being "ASC" or "DESC"), add tests to see how invalid inputs are handled (though currently, it seems these are passed directly to the API).

2.  **Snapshot Testing for Complex Responses**:
    *   **Why**: For API methods returning large, complex JSON objects, asserting every field is tedious and makes tests brittle.
    *   **Action**: Consider using a snapshot testing library (e.g., `pytest-snapshot`). The first run saves the API response as a "snapshot." Subsequent runs compare the new response against this snapshot. This is great for detecting unexpected changes in API response structures.

3.  **Configuration/CLI Tests**:
    *   **Why**: Your `main()` function uses `argparse`.
    *   **Action**: Add tests for the command-line interface:
        *   Test parsing of arguments like `--base-url`, `--transport`, `--log-level`.
        *   Test default values.
        *   Test if the `CBioPortalMCPServer` is instantiated with the correct `base_url`.

4.  **Logging Tests**:
    *   **Why**: The server configures logging.
    *   **Action**: Verify that important events (e.g., server start, shutdown, errors) are logged correctly at the appropriate levels. `pytest` has built-in support for capturing logs (`caplog` fixture).

## IV. Test Environment and Maintainability

1.  **Python Path Management**:
    *   **Why**: `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` can sometimes be brittle.
    *   **Action**: Consider running tests with the package installed in editable mode (`uv pip install -e .` or `pip install -e .`). This makes imports more standard.

2.  **Consistent Mocking Strategy**:
    *   **Why**: Ensure mocks are applied at the right level. Mocking `_make_api_request` is good for testing the logic within your server methods.
    *   **Action**: Continue with the strategy of mocking `_make_api_request` for most unit tests, as it isolates your server logic from the actual `httpx` calls and the external API.
