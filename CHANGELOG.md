#### Pagination Completion

- **Milestone**: Pagination support has been fully implemented and verified across all collection-returning API methods in the server.
  - All relevant methods now accept `page_number`, `page_size`, `sort_by`, `direction`, and `limit` parameters.
  - Each method returns a response with a `pagination` metadata dictionary for consistent client consumption.
  - Special handling for `limit=0` (fetch all results) is in place where supported by the API.
  - Methods covered:
    - `get_cancer_studies`
    - `get_cancer_types`
    - `get_samples_in_study`
    - `search_genes`
    - `search_studies`
    - `get_molecular_profiles`
    - `get_mutations_in_gene`
    - `get_clinical_data`

- **Quality Improvements**:
  - Audited all endpoints to ensure no collection-returning method is missing pagination support.
  - Standardized error handling and response formatting for paginated endpoints.

  - Analyzed cBioPortal API v2 Swagger documentation
  - Discovered and explored cBioPortal API v3 (OpenAPI 3.1.0) documentation
  - Documented differences between v2 and v3 APIs
  - Identified key endpoints and patterns for data retrieval

#### Code Improvements

- **Pagination Support**: Added LLM-optimized pagination to collection-based methods:
  - `get_cancer_studies`: Added pagination, sorting, and limit parameters
  - `get_cancer_types`: Added pagination, sorting, and limit parameters
  - `get_samples_in_study`: Added pagination, sorting, and limit parameters
  - `search_genes`: Added pagination, sorting, and limit parameters
  
- **Response Structure Optimization**:
  - Restructured method responses for better LLM interaction
  - Added consistent pagination metadata across methods
  - Implemented `has_more` flag for easier pagination state tracking
  
- **Method Parameter Enhancements**:
  - Added `gene_id_type` and `projection` parameters to `get_genes`
  - Improved method documentation with detailed parameter descriptions
  - Added explanations of valid values for enumeration parameters

#### LLM Interaction Optimizations

- **Context Window Management**: Set conservative default page sizes (50 items)
- **Progressive Information Retrieval**: Added `limit` parameter to control total results
- **Explicit Documentation**: Added detailed comments explaining valid sort fields for each method

#### Bug Fixes (Post-Pagination Implementation)

- **Server-Side Logic (`cbioportal_server.py`)**:
  - Corrected the API endpoint in the `search_genes` method from `genes/search` to the standard `genes` endpoint. This resolves an issue where tests for gene searching were failing due to an incorrect API path.
  - Revised the `has_more` pagination flag calculation in the following methods to accurately reflect whether more data might be available from the API, rather than relying on the count of items on the current page:
    - `get_cancer_studies`
    - `get_cancer_types`
    - `get_samples_in_study`
    - `search_genes`
    - `get_mutations_in_gene`
    - `get_clinical_data`
  - This change fixes previous assertion errors in tests where the `has_more` flag was incorrectly `False` when subsequent pages were expected.

#### Code Improvements & Linting

- **Code Health in `cbioportal_server.py`**:
  - Removed unused Python imports (`json`, `os`, `dotenv.load_dotenv`) to clean up the codebase.
  - Refactored error message string formatting:
    - Converted f-strings to regular strings in instances where placeholders were not actually used, addressing lint warnings.
    - Ensured that `study_id` (and other relevant variables) are correctly included in error messages for methods like `get_mutations_in_gene`, `get_clinical_data`, and `get_study_details` by using f-strings appropriately. This restores clarity to error messages that were inadvertently made generic.

#### Pagination Logic Completion and Testing

- **Test Suite Fixes**:
  - Fixed test failures related to multiple API calls in `get_mutations_in_gene` by:
    - Updating tests to use `assert_has_calls()` instead of `assert_called_with()`
    - Correctly mocking both the molecular profiles request and the mutations request in sequence
    - Adding proper side effect patterns for mock API responses in sequence
  - Fixed test failures in `get_clinical_data` tests by:
    - Accounting for the patient-centric data structure where multiple clinical data entries are consolidated per patient
    - Updating response validation to correctly check unique patient counts instead of raw data counts
    - Adding proper test cases for both GET and POST API request paths

- **API Response Consistency**:
  - Modified the `get_clinical_data` method to calculate `total_found` based on the number of unique patients rather than raw clinical data entries
  - This ensures the pagination metadata accurately reflects the actual data returned to clients
  - Improved test assertions to verify that pagination structure is consistent with the response content

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Added `fastmcp>=0.1.0` to `requirements.txt` to support server functionality
  - Updated project to properly use the latest fastmcp package for MCP server implementation

- **Code Architecture Improvements**:
  - Ensured all tests correctly model the internal behavior of methods that make multiple API calls
  - Improved mock setup to better simulate the actual API responses
  - Added better test documentation to explain the data transformation from raw API responses to structured client data

#### Validation Results

- **Test Status**:
  - Successfully completed all 15 tests with no failures or errors
  - Confirmed proper pagination behavior for all collection-returning methods
  - Verified correct API endpoint usage for all methods
  - Ensured the `has_more` flag correctly indicates when additional pages of data might be available
